# Test subsmission for Arena by Steve Batcup

# Please note: I made a few adjustments to the webserver.log file so as to produce more obvious results
# - added a few blank lines
# - added invalid rows (missing url or ip address)
# - added and removed a few items so as to avoid all unique view counts resulting in 20, thus they can be more explicitly ordered

# Built using local Ruby v2.7.0 and RSpec 3.9
